# Create a Tableau Story

My submission for creating a tableau story for Udacity's Data Analyst degree.

## Layout

`Write-up.md` contains links to tableau notebook and details about the visualization process

`Final_titanic_dataset.csv` is the final data source

'Titanic_analysis.ipynb' contains some exploratory code and preprocessing of titanic data
